{@link peersim.core.Control} classes for initializing a network or 
modifying it during simulation.
<p>
Among other things, this package includes classes for the following two
purposes:
<ul>
  <li> <em>wiring:</em> used to wire network topologies
    like ring lattices, regular random graphs, scale-free networks,
    etc. It is also possible to wire networks using an arbitrary custom
    made method using {@link peersim.dynamics.WireByMethod}.</li>
  <li> <em>churn:</em> used to simulate node addition and removal
  patterns (aka churn)</li>
</ul>
