This package contains dynamics and observers capable to generically
modify and analyze vectors of protocol instances.
<p>
The idea is the following: all the protocol instances contained
by nodes in the network define a <i>protocol vector</i>. This
package handles protocol vectors as a whole: for example, by
observing one of its fields and reporting aggregation statistics
over them (like average, variance, etc.).
<p>
Originally, this package was designed to interact with protocols
implementing the {@link peersim.vector.SingleValue} interface, containing a
getter and a setter method for interacting with a double value.
The current implementation is backward-compatible with this
design, meaning that it works with {@link peersim.vector.SingleValue} as
default, but it has also been extended in order to initialize
and observe generic fields and generic primitive types.
<p>
Thanks to Java reflection, it is now possible to specify 
getter/setter methods that read/modify a generic field
in the protocol vector.
<p>
Getter methods are characterized as follows:
<ul>
<li> their return type is not void; </li>
<li> their argument list is empty.
</ul>
<p>
Setter methods are characterized as follows:
<ul>
<li> their return type is void; </li>
<li> their argument list is composed by exactly one parameter.
</ul>
