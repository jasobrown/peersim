Classes and interfaces for simulating transport-level communication
in overlay networks.
This is achieved by classes implementing the interface
{@link peersim.transport.Transport}, that are repsonsible for modeling
message delay, message omissions, etc

<p>
It is also possible to use models of the underlying router network
to determine latency ({@link peersim.transport.E2ETransport}).
This model is stored in static singleton {@link peersim.transport.E2ENetwork}.
This class can be initialized by controls using eg measurement data
({@link peersim.transport.KingParser}). To be usable, nodes must be assigned
to routers. An example control that does that is
{@link peersim.transport.UniformRouterAssignment}.
