Classes that make it possible to modify and analyze numeric vectors
defined by the vector of protocol instances in the network.
<p>
The idea is the following: all the protocol instances contained
by nodes in the network define a <i>protocol vector</i>. This
package handles protocol vectors as a whole: for example, by
observing one of its fields and reporting aggregation statistics
over them (like average, variance, etc.).
<p>
Originally, this package was designed to interact with protocols
implementing the {@link peersim.vector.SingleValue} interface, containing a
getter and a setter method for interacting with a double value.
The current implementation is backward-compatible with this
design, meaning that it works with {@link peersim.vector.SingleValue} as
default, but it has also been extended in order to initialize
and observe generic fields and generic primitive types.
In this general case, the getter and setter methods that read and write
this field have to be explicitly given in the configuration.
<p>
Getter methods must have a signature as follows:
<ul>
<li> their return type is a primitive numeric type
(int, long, float or double) </li>
<li> their argument list is empty
</ul>
<p>
Setter methods are characterized as follows:
<ul>
<li> their return type is void </li>
<li> they have exactly one argument of a primitive numeric type (int, long,
float or double)
</ul>
<p>
Although there are other numberic types such as byte and short, they are
not supported. They can be represented as an int in a protocol.
