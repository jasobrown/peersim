Dynamics classes for initializing a network or 
modifying it during simulation.
<p>
Current classes can be subdivided in two groups:
<ul>
  <li> <em>wiring classes</em> are used to wire network topologies
    like ring lattices, regular random graphs, scale-free networks,
    etc. </li>
  <li> <em>churn classes</em> are used to simulate churn; </li>
</ul>
