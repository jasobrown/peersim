Upgraded GraphPrinter so that it can print to files that can be
read by WireFromFile. Added method writeNeighborList to GraphIO.

Added new class peersim.dynamics.WireFromFile

Fixed bug in peersim.util.WeightedRandPerm which accepted
non-positive weights

Added peersim.reports.SingleValueObserver

Added new modifier classes, which can set numeric parameters of
network nodes according the some specified pattern. Originally this
was in aggregation but refactored to be more general.

Refactoring: added classes from peersim.init into peersim.dynamics
and now Dynamics is used also instead of the old Initializer. This
involved quite a number of files. Note that config files don't break
because the init entries are now simply loaded as dynamics that are
scheduled to execute only before the simulation, once. The change
was trivial in all files, just renaming.

Added class peersim.dynamics.Shuffle

Made class peersim.graph.NeighborListGraph public

fixed bug in GeneralNode with failstate handling

added curent node to CommonState. When a protocol is executing,
it is the node hosting the protocol. Modified simulators too to
record this info.

fixed some config files in lpbcast and scamp packages
