Configuration management.
It contains classes that read, store and to some extent process the
system-wide configuration of the simulation.
<p>
The two main classes are {@link peersim.config.Configuration}, that actually
stores the configuration and allows any class to read it, and
{@link peersim.config.ParsedProperties} that is used to read configuration
from a properties file and the command line, to initialize
{@link peersim.config.Configuration}.
