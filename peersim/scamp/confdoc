# The prefix structure of the properties in this file is self explaining.
# One note is needed: currently for the property arrays that are defined
# by the postfixes .0, .1, etc, there are strict restrictions. That is,
# the first element must always have postfix be .0, and the second .1, atc.
# This means that eg if .0 is missing, then no properties will be read
# even if .1 is present. As another example, if .0, .1, .3 are present, only
# 0. and .1 will be read.
