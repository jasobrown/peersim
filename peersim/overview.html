The PeerSim simulator. A good starting point is {@link peersim.Simulator},
which contains the main method and which is therefore the entry point of the
system.
<h2>Conventions over Exceptions</h2>
In this documentation we treat exceptions as follows.
We do not always document three kinds of exceptions:
<code>RuntimeException</code>, {@link peersim.config.IllegalParameterException}
and {@link peersim.config.MissingParameterException}.
The last two are thrown when there is a problem while reading the configuration.
The <code>RuntimeException</code> should be thrown in case of any other
problem during the running of the simulator such as file i/o, etc.
We always document those exceptions that are different from these three
or that are explicitly declared in the API.
<p>
Note that the component that actually handles these exceptions is
the main class {@link peersim.Simulator}.
It always exits as a result of any exceptions, after attempting to
dump some information about the details of the failure on the standard
error.
This is the main reason why we are intentionally sloppy about documenting all
the exceptions.
