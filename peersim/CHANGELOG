MJ 11/03/2005
- BallExpansion is revised and now accepts parameter "stats".
- IncrementalStats is extended with a new method to add an item k times.

MJ 03/03/2005
- GraphPrinter is extended with a new format and the possibility to save the
  undirected version of the overlay. See class docs.

MJ 02/03/2005
- DegreeStats is extended by new options, to collect statistics about
  dead links. See class documentation.

MJ (adding changes by Spyros Voulgaris) 16/02/2005
- DegreeStats now uses the (now correct) degree method instead of the size
  of the returned neighbor list.

MJ (adding changes by Spyros Voulgaris) 15/02/2005
- OverlayNetwork had bugs: degree and getNeighbours did not conform
  to the contract that only those links count for which both ends
  are up. Fixed that. this means, degree(i) will return the number of
  neighbors that are up, and will return 0 if node i is down. Similarly,
  getNeighbours(i) returns an empty list if node i is down.

MJ 02/02/2005
- peersim.vetor.Normalizer now handles all zero vectors by throwing
  an exception.

MJ 01/02/2005
- added the "undirected" option to WireFromFile, which makes it possible
  to convert a directed graph stored in a file to an undirected one.

MJ 22/01/2005
- Moved the wiring algorithm from WireScaleFreeBA to GraphFactory
  and added the possibility to generate a directed version.
  Now, the "undirected" config parameter has to be given to get
  an unirected graph. This breaks backwards compatibility, but I prefer
  to have a consistent set of parameters for the wiring classes.
  Also, some pretty printing changes on some wiring classes.

AM 19/01/2005
- Fixed a bug in ClassFinder, that was preventing it to run on
  Windows.
- Added a mechanism for running a class that implements both
  the CDProtocol and EDProtocol interface just as an EDProtocol.
- Now the prototype node has an index of -1 (to avoid confusion
  with node with index 0)

MJ 09/01/2005
- Fixed a bug in PeakDistribution: it did not initialize as many nodes
  as the number of peaks. Eg with one peak, one node is not initialized.

MJ 06/01/2005
VERSION 0.3 RELEASED
------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------

MJ 04/01/2005
- Minor changes to make some docs consistent with actual behavior and
  vice versa

AM 02/01/2005
- Added the "pack" parameter (originally included in WireRegularRandom)
  to all the Wire* classes. When this parameter is present, the pack()
  method is called over the initialized protocol after all links have
  been wired.

MJ 02/01/2005
- Fixed bug in WireScaleFreeBA: it ocasionally generated loop edges and in
  general did not follow the BA model.

AM 30/12/2004
- Modified Makefile to remove "distributions" from the list of
  packages that are inserted in the distribution.

AM 30/12/2004
- Modified aggregation to use to the new vector package. All the
  implementation now use double instead of float.

MJ 30/12/2004
- Refactoring of classes that have to do with vector-like operations
  on an array of values, where each element of the array is stored
  by an instance of a SingleValue protocol. A new package called
  peersim.vector was created and everything is moved there.
- New classes dealing with vectors (see above) are added such as
  observers and dynamics, into package peersim.vector.

MJ 27/12/2004
- Changed print in IncrementalFreq to print only those lines that have
  non-zero frequency. Thanks to Spyros Voulgaris for pointing out the
  problem.
- Some minor refactoring and docs enhancement.

GJ 19/12/2004
- Fixed a Scamp cast bug in order to compile on JDK 1.5 . 

MJ 16/12/2004
- Fixed docs bug in FastConfig, thanks to Spyros Voulgaris, and added
  hasLinkable.

GJ 15/12/2004
- Added ExtendedRandom class to support power-law distribution generation
  (thanks to Simon Patarin for this code).
- Updated CommonRandom class: now uses the an ExtendedRandom object.  

AM 25/11/2004
- Changed the implementation of the Event-driven simulator in order to
  support 64 bits for time. Part of these bits (by default: 8) are used
  to discriminate between events that occur at the same time.
- Added getCycle and getTime methods to CommonState. getCycle() is just
  new version of getT, which is now deprecated. getTime() returns the
  current time in event-based simulations, and the current cycle in
  cycle-based ones.
- Modified all the peersim observers and dynamics that uses time, that
  now use getTime instead of getCycle. In this way, they are compatible
  with both ed and cd simulations.

JM 17/11/2004
- Small non-critical changes like docs, message texts, formatting, etc, plus
  changes step to cstep in DaemonProtocol to avoid conflict with scheduling

GJ 11/11/2004
- Refactored aggregation and load balancing example code: now they use 
  distribution.SingleValueHolder class and peersim.core.SingleValue interface
  instead of example.aggregation.AbstractFunction and 
  example.aggregation.Aggregation interface.
- example.aggregation.AbstractFunction class and
  example.aggregation.Aggregationinterface removed to avoid code replication.

JM 9/11/2004
- removed Protocols, added peersim.config.FastConfig instead. The new feature
  is that FastConfig is automatic, it reads and stores "linkable" config lines
  in a transparent fashion to the protocols.
- toString method to SingleValueHolder, and made value protected
- stripped Node interface to those methods that were actually used

JM 9/11/2004
- added nextLong(long) to CommonRandom

AM 6/11/2004
- added event-based simulator in package peersim.edsim
- added transport protocols in package peersim.transport
- added class peersim.Simulator to serve as the new entry point to peersim.
  It looks at the configuration and launches the right simulator. Check
  the classdocs of peersim.Simulator.
  
MJ 3/11/2004:
VERSION 0.2 RELEASED
------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------

GJ 3/11/2004
- Added MedianStats class. It extracts the median value from a data collection;
  it subclasses the IncrementalStats class.

MJ 2/11/2004
- changed config parameter name "protocolID" to "protocol" in package
  distributions. Protocol id is an internal concept now, transparent to the
  user and protocol name should be used (which can also be a number of course).

MJ 29/10/2004
- new constructor parameter for OverlayGraph so that setEdge could work in
  an undirected manner (sets opposite edge too). OverlayGraph is interpreted as
  directed, nontheless, because setEdge is not the only way to set edges.
- wireRegularRandom has new config parameter "undirected", which uses the
  feature above 
- new toString to IdleProtocol, 

MJ 25/10/2004
- added method lookupPid to Configuration to make it possible to search
  for a protocol id based on the protocol name

MJ 22/10/2004
- added the possibility of excluding entities that are present in the config
  using a simple config parameter: eg "include observer aa bb 23". This
  works exactly like the order feature only those names that are not listed
  are excluded. [see classdoc of Configuration]
- some more minor refactoring of Simulator and OrderSimulator

MJ 21/10/2004
- some refactoring of the most recent changes for simplification and
  clarification and which include
  - moving order-handling into Configuration and so removing it from the
    rest of the code: now ordering is transparent to Simulator.
  - removing setPid from Configuration and funtionality to assign ID-s to
    protocols names is also moved into Configuration completely. The rest of
    the code now can use simply getPid after loading the config to get
    protocol id.
  - separating alternative style of configuration to the new OrderSimulator
    that now extends the basic Simulator class. to use the config property
    "order" you need to launch OrderSimultor. All other features and orderings
    like "order.protocol" are understood by Simulator too.
- enhancement of documentation by adding stuff written by Alberto to the class
  docs of OrderSimulator and Configuration.

AM 17/10/2004
- RangeSimulator: now it works by calling Simulator, so we don't
  need to maintain two simulators. Using RangeSimulator
  you can write stuff like this:
  range.0 MAG;10:18
  meaning that the variable MAG will go from 10 to 18.
- Expression parsing added. Now it is possible to use expression in place
  of simple numeric values in the configuration (with all simulators),
  using property names as symbols.
  [JM 21/10/2004: See the class docs of Configuration]
- Protocol schedulers. 
  Now protocols are scheduled as the other objects. Eg you can execute
  a protocol every two steps.
- now it's possible to use not only number but also any
  alphanumeric symbol to identify a protocol, observer, etc (eg protocol.first).
  The Configuration now has a getPid method that assigns a fixed numeric ID to
  a protocol, becuase it is still much more efficient to use numbers
  internally.
  
  !!WARNING!!: this change is backwards compatible but if you want to use
  arbitrary protocol id-s in you new config files, you mut use the
  getPid method to get the numeric id in your new protocols.
- ordering: apart from the deault aplhabetical order of component execution
  it is possible to define an alternative ordering using order properties in
  the configuration, like protocol.order, observer.order, etc. 
- If config parameter "order" is defined, it switches the simulator into
  a new style of operation that is completely detremined by this parameter,
  that allows for an ordering of all components relative to each other. Eg
  order observer.0,protocol.sort,observer.2,protocol.rank,dynamics.crash
  [JM 21/10/2004: See the class docs of OrderSimulator]

AM 15/10/2004
- added the peersim.config.ClassFinder class, whose task is to
  associate non-qualified names to qualified names. 
- changed peersim.config.Configuration to use ClassFinder.
  Now it is possible to specify a non-qualified class name in
  configuration files. If a unique package-qualified class is
  found, it is used to create new instances. Otherwise,
  smart error messages are printed, when possible.


MJ 14/10/2004:
VERSION 0.1 RELEASED
------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------

AM 14/10/2004
- added maxcount and mincount to the toString method of 
  peersim.util.IncrementalStats
- added a print(String prefix) method to peersim.util.IncrementalFreq 
  that uses the Log facility to print
- protocols are not nullified in GeneralNode when the node is declared DEAD
- observers, initializers and dynamics are not required to be tagged by
  consecutive numbers any more; this is not the final version of what
  we have discussed, it is just a small hack, compatible with the past,
  that I've implemented in Configuration.java
- small changes to RangeSimulator; in any case, it will updated in order
  to be based on the Simulator code.

AM 22/6/2004:
In GeneralNode, when creating/cloning a node, the CommonState.setNode()
method is invoked to set the current node being created.

AM 22/6/2004:
peersim.cdsim.RangeSimulator, added support for idle protocols. When
a protocol has the idle flag in its specification (like protocol.0.idle),
the nextCycle method is not called. This can be useful for protocols
reuse.

AM 22/6/2004:
peersim.core.Shuffle, example.hot.InetInitializer, example.hot.RobustnessEvaluator,
example.loadbalance.AvgBalance, example.loadbalance.BasicBalance
removed unused import(s)

AM 22/6/2004:
Moved LinearDistribution, UniformDistribution and PeakDistribution to
a new package called distributions (outside peersim, but to be included
in the peersim software distribution).

Implemented NodeInitializer in LinearDistribution and UniformDistribution,
to provide values also when new nodes are added dynamically.

Added classes SingleValueHolder and SingleValueComparator

Name change: peersim.util.ExtendedStats => peersim.util.MomentStats 

Added peersim.cdsim.DaemonProtocol as a generic entry point for all
kinds of hacks, to avoid complicating the simulator. It can be used
to run observers and modifiers several times within one cycle.

Added cycle time to peersim.core.CommonState and modified
peersim.cdsim.Simulator to handle this feature. It records the number
of nodes already visited in a given cycle (makes sense only for cycle based
simulation).

Added peersim.example.hot package : classes to model a preferential
attachment internet like topology

Added peersim.util.ExtendedStats class 

peersim.util.IncrementalFreq now accepts an upper bound on the
processed values

peersim.cdsim.Simulator now outputs two blank lines between
experiments

Upgraded GraphPrinter so that it can print to files that can be
read by WireFromFile. Added method writeNeighborList to GraphIO.

Added new class peersim.dynamics.WireFromFile

Fixed bug in peersim.util.WeightedRandPerm which accepted
non-positive weights

Added peersim.reports.SingleValueObserver

Added new modifier classes, which can set numeric parameters of
network nodes according the some specified pattern. Originally this
was in aggregation but refactored to be more general.

Refactoring: added classes from peersim.init into peersim.dynamics
and now Dynamics is used also instead of the old Initializer. This
involved quite a number of files. Note that config files don't break
because the init entries are now simply loaded as dynamics that are
scheduled to execute only before the simulation, once. The change
was trivial in all files, just renaming.

Added class peersim.dynamics.Shuffle

Made class peersim.graph.NeighborListGraph public

fixed bug in GeneralNode with failstate handling

added curent node to CommonState. When a protocol is executing,
it is the node hosting the protocol. Modified simulators too to
record this info.

fixed some config files in lpbcast and scamp packages
