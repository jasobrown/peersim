pippo
This is version 1.0 of the iSearch framework.
It is an addon package for Peersim, providing simple overlay search
features and message routingon top of the cycle-based simulation 
environment.
In other words, here we have a real message echange instead of a method 
invocation. 
However, this package is not memory efficient and will scale very poorly 
with network size. The event-based simulation model is much better and 
feature rich than iSearch.

To run the example, you need java 5 and Peersim installed, and then type:

java peersim.Simulator configs/config-isearch.txt

in the directory of this README file in the extracted archive.
