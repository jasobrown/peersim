This is version 1.0.5 of the Peersim high level P2P network simulator.

This archive is composed of:
- the doc/ directory containing the javadoc-generated documentation
- the src/ directory containing the simulator source
- the example/ directory containing example configuration files
- peersim-1.0.5.jar, a java archive containing the compiled bytecode
- jep-2.3.0.jar and djep-1.0.0.jar, a Java Mathematical Expression Parser
